## Overview

In medical settings, capturing information from conversations between doctors and patients can be valuable for creating structured records, which can aid in analysis and follow-up care. This repository demonstrates how to use the `nuextract` model from Ollama to parse conversation text and extract relevant information, including symptoms, assessments, diagnoses, and treatment plans.

## Features

- **Automated information extraction**: Extracts structured data fields such as symptoms, assessments, and prescriptions from raw text.
- **Flexible template system**: Customize the extraction template to match your specific data fields.
- **Ollama API integration**: Uses the `nuextract` model from Ollama for efficient information extraction.
- **Easy-to-use interface**: Run the extraction with a few lines of code.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/heydibyendu/nuextract.git
   cd nuextract
   ```
## Usage

1. Define your input conversation text and extraction template.
2. Use the extract_info function to retrieve structured information.
3. Print or save the results as needed.

## Example

```Input Text

Doctor: Not too high â€“ 99.8.
... (conversation continues)
```
Template Structure
```
{
  "Doctor_Patient_Discussion": {
    "Initial_Observation": {
      "Symptoms": [],
      "Initial_Assessment": ""
    },
    "Medical_Examination": {
      "Temperature": "",
      "Blood_Pressure": "",
      "Doctor_Assessment": "",
      "Diagnosis": ""
    },
    "Treatment_Plan": {
      "Prescription": []
    }
  }
}
```
Output Example
```
{
  "Doctor_Patient_Discussion": {
    "Initial_Observation": {
      "Symptoms": ["pale", "sore throat", "running a temperature"],
      "Initial_Assessment": "You look pale and your voice is out of tune"
    },
    "Medical_Examination": {
      "Temperature": "99.8",
      "Blood_Pressure": "fine",
      "Doctor_Assessment": "It looks bit scruffy. Not good",
      "Diagnosis": "few symptoms of malaria"
    },
    "Treatment_Plan": {
      "Prescription": ["three medicines", "a syrup"]
    }
  }
}
```
## Template Structure

The template is a dictionary that defines the fields to be extracted from the conversation. Each key represents a category, such as Initial_Observation, Medical_Examination, and Treatment_Plan. Customize the template according to your needs to include other medical information fields as necessary.

## Output Example

The extracted information is returned in JSON format based on the template structure, capturing all key details from the conversation text.
